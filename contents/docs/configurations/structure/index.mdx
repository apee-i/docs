title: Basic File Configurations
description: This portion defines all the basic requirements of a JSON or YAML file which they must contain in order for Apee-i to function properly.
---

## Base URL

You can define base URL for your API endpoint so you don't have to right it again and again.
<Note title="Note" type="warning">
	You must add the **Base URL** according to the environments even if they are the same. This allows you to have different URLs based on the 
	environments.
</Note>

**JSON Based**

```json
{
	"baseUrl": {
		"development": "http://localhost:3000/api",
		"staging": "https://staging.com/api",
		"production": "https://production.com/api"
	}
}
```

and the same structure is followed in YAML

**YAML Based**

```yaml
baseUrl:
  development: http://localhost:3000/api
  staging: http://staging.com/api
  production: http://production.com/api
```

## Credentials

You can set the body you need to send in order to login the user. This body can contain your test user's email, password, etc. This can also be set according to the environments like so.

**JSON Based**
```json
{
	.
	.
	.
	"credentials": {
		"development": {
			"email": "john@doe.com",
			"password": "test-password"
		},
		"staging": {
			"email": "john@doe.com",
			"password": "test-password"
		},
		"production": {
			"email": "john@doe.com",
			"password": "test-password"
		},
	}
}
```

And in YAML we can do it like...

**YAML Based**
```yaml
.
.
.
credentials:
  development:
    email: john@doe.com
    password: test-password
  staging:
    email: john@doe.com
    password: test-password
  production:
    email: john@doe.com
    password: test-password
```
<Note title="Note that" type="warning">
	These fields below are required and `apee-i` won't function properly if these properties are not filled properly.
</Note>
At this point, your file should look like this

**JSON Based**

```json
{
	"baseUrl": {
		"development": "http://localhost:3000/api",
		"staging": "https://staging.com/api",
		"production": "https://production.com/api"
	},
	"credentials": {
		"development": {
			"email": "john@doe.com",
			"password": "test-password"
		},
		"staging": {
			"email": "john@doe.com",
			"password": "test-password"
		},
		"production": {
			"email": "john@doe.com",
			"password": "test-password"
		}
	}
}
```

**YAML Based**
```yaml
baseUrl:
  development: http://localhost:3000/api
  staging: http://staging.com/api
  production: http://production.com/api

credentials:
  development:
    email: john@doe.com
    password: test-password
  staging:
    email: john@doe.com
    password: test-password
  production:
    email: john@doe.com
    password: test-password
```

## Login Details

This portion is another important part if you want to use **authentication** in your APIs. Currently `apee-i` only supports **JWT** auth but more 
are expected to join the party soon ðŸŽ‰

**JSON Based**
```json
{
	"loginDetails": {
		"route": "/login",
		"type": "JWT",
		"token_location": "data.access_token"
	}
}
```
**YAML Based**
```yaml
loginDetails:
  route: /login
  type: JWT
  token_location: data.access_token
```

* **route** is the login API endpoint
* **type** is the authentication type your application uses 
* **token_location** is the location where the JWT token will be found in response

## Required Structure

This below is the minimum required structure of your configuration file in order to start performing tests on your API endpoints. You can copy the
below files to get started.

<Note title="File Specify">
	If you don't define the file specifically, the **apee-i** will assume that your root directory where you are currently working has a file named
	**api.json**. If you want to use **yaml** structure or your file has other name, you can do that by:
	```bash
	apee-i --file=<file_name>.<json|yaml>
	```
</Note>

**JSON Based**

```json
{
	"baseUrl": {
		"development": "http://localhost:3000/api",
		"staging": "https://staging.com/api",
		"production": "https://production.com/api"
	},
	"credentials": {
		"development": {
			"email": "john@doe.com",
			"password": "test-password"
		},
		"staging": {
			"email": "john@doe.com",
			"password": "test-password"
		},
		"production": {
			"email": "john@doe.com",
			"password": "test-password"
		}
	},
	"loginDetails": {
		"route": "/login",
		"type": "JWT",
		"token_location": "data.access_token"
	}
}
```

**YAML Based**
```yaml
baseUrl:
  development: http://localhost:3000/api
  staging: http://staging.com/api
  production: http://production.com/api

credentials:
  development:
    email: john@doe.com
    password: test-password
  staging:
    email: john@doe.com
    password: test-password
  production:
    email: john@doe.com
    password: test-password

loginDetails:
  route: /login
  type: JWT
  token_location: data.access_token
```


This setup is enough to give `apee-i` it's basic information. You can now simply add requests to current pipelines which can then be called to 
test your APIs. Follow the next page to start using your new favourite API client.
