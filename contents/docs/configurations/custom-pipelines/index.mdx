title: Custom Pipelines
description: These pipelines can be stored and used to test your APIs. This ensures all the APIs are working fine, sort of perform integration test on your application.
---

You can define as many custom pipelines as you want and then call all of them at once or simply call a single one from all the pre-defined pipelines.

## Sample File

This is a sample file based on which we will be performing our actions and showing you how to define and call custom pipelines in `apee-i`.

**JSON Based**
```json
{
	.
	.
	.
	"custom_pipelines": {
		"users": [
			{
				"endpoint": "/users"
			},
			{
				"endpoint": "/users/1",
				"method": "PATCH",
				"body": {
					"age": 1
				},
				"expectedStatusCode": 403
			},
			{
				"endpoint": "/users/1",
				"method": "PATCH",
				"body": {
					"age": 1
				},
				"headers": {
					"x-api-token": "some_random_token"
				},
				"expectedStatusCode": 200
			}
		],
		"clubs": [
			{
				"endpoint": "/clubs"
			},
			{
				"endpoint": "/clubs",
				"method": "POST",
				"body": {
					"name": "XYZ"
				}
			},
			{
				"endpoint": "/clubs/2",
				"method": "DELETE"
			}
		]
	}
}
```

**YAML Based**
```yaml
.
.
.
custom_pipelines:
	users:
		- endpoint: /users
		- endpoint: /users/1
		  method: PATCH
		  body:
		  	age: 1
		  expectedStatusCode: 403
		- endpoint: /users/1
		  method: PATCH
		  body:
		  	age: 1
		  headers:
		  	x-api-token: some_random_token
		  expectedStatusCode: 403
	clubs:
		- endpoint: /clubs
		- endpoint: /clubs
		  method: POST
		  body:
		  	name: XYZ
		- endpoint: /clubs/2
		  method: DELETE

```

## Use Apee-i

Now using `apee-i` to call your custom pipelines is fairly easy. You just have to mention the `pipeline` flag and `name` flag to make these calls.

### Single Pipeline

You can call a single pipeline as...

```bash
apee-i --pipeline=custom --name=<name>
```

This will call all the users pipeline in the custom pipelines.

```bash
apee-i --pipeline=custom --name=users
```

This will call all the clubs pipeline in the custom pipelines.

```bash
apee-i --pipeline=custom --name=clubs
```

Or you can simply call all the APIs in the pipelines, meaning it will call the sections in the custom pipelines.

```bash
apee-i --pipeline=all
```
