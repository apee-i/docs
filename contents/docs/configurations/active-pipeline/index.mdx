title: Active Pipeline
description: This is the pipeline that runs by default. All the APIs are executed in a sequence one by one ensuring the desired behaviour.
---

You can put in it as much API requests as you wish to make in a sequence. This allows you to test mulitple APIs in a sequence and see the desired
results in a well formatted output on the console of your terminal.

<Note title="Note" type="success">
	Active/Current pipeline is by-default selected so you don't have to select it manually by passing in the flag. However, you can if you want to
	by:
	```bash
	apee-i --pipeline=current
	```
